# **Hobbies**

One of thing I've always loved was working with my hands. Being able to creat and make things have always brough me a special joy, especially once those projects are completed.  Unfortunately with my busy schedule it doesn't always turn out that way.

## **Cross Stitch**

Cross Stitch has been a favorite hobbie of mine for a long time now. The image to the right is one the the projects that I did for my mother since she loves dash hounds and has three of them. Now this one being relatively small and not very complicated since it's mostly block lettering with a simple dog design didn't take me very long to do. Other projects have taken me a long time to complete due to the  complexity of the pieces. One such project that I am currently working on I've been doing for a couple months now and am not even a fraction of the way through. It's a [Yin Yan][1] pattern where _yin_ is the sun and mountains, and _yen_ is the night sky and oceans. To date it is one of the biggest pieces I have ever done and I feel like its going to take me quite a while to finish(especially with work and school so busy).
