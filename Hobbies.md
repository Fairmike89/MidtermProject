# **Hobbies**

One of thing I've always loved was working with my hands. Being able to creat and make things have always brough me a special joy, especially once those projects are completed.  Unfortunately with my busy schedule it doesn't always turn out that way.

## **Cross Stitch**

Cross Stitch has been a favorite hobbie of mine for a long time now. Back when I was first learning how to cross stitch there were not very many videos online about it. There were some that showed basic technique but not really more in-depth ones. So learnig how to cross stitch was kind of a trial and error. The image to the left is one the the projects that I did for my mother since she loves dash hounds and has three of them. Now this one being relatively small and not very complicated since it's mostly block lettering with a simple dog design didn't take me very long to do. Other projects have taken me a long time to complete due to the  complexity of the pieces. One such project that I am currently working on I've been doing for a couple months now and am not even a fraction of the way through. It's a [Yin Yan][1] pattern where _yin_ is the sun and mountains, and _yen_ is the night sky and oceans. To date it is one of the biggest pieces I have ever done and I feel like its going to take me quite a while to finish(especially with work and school so busy). But in whatever spare time I have I like to work on a little bit of it at a time.  

## **Crochet**

Unlike when learning to cross stitch there were and are a lot of different videos on YouTube for learning how to Chrochet. One of my favorite videos to learn and practice with was one by [Bella Coco](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npIsh-o9AM0&t=390s) who does a really in-depth video on how to make _Granny Squares_ a classic crochet design. The image to the left is an example of a standard patteren. However they can come in many different style and designs. I have been crocheting even longer then I have been doing cross stitch. Most of my projects are small though. Hats and scarves mostly, but I do like making stuffed animals too when I have the time. One of my favorites to do is a crochet bear from [Sharon Ojala's](https://www.amigurumitogo.com/2014/11/crochet-teddy-bear-youtube-tutorial.html) free pattern on her blog. She also has a [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtAM9E7qsH0) video that you can follow a long to with great  instructions that make it so much easier to learn from. With both her video and the writen pattern, it made it a lot easier for me a leat to learn how to read crochet patterns so that now as long as I have the pattern I can re-creat the projects(though follow a long videos are **_always_** great). 

## Others

These are just some my just my favorite two crafts, the ones I get to do more often then others. I like to dable in a lot of different things. **Cooking** being one of my favorites, I love trying out new recipes. **Baking** I try at but am not very good, and if things are not exactly right the whole thing will be messed up. With cooking 9 times out of 10 even if you mess up something or other its still edible and probablly tasts fine, just not like it was suppose to. In baking you make one mistake and it's all downhill. Reading is also something I really enjoy doing which I have a section on [books](BookList.md) here on this site.
