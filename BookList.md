# **Book List**

Ever since I was around the age of 14 reading has always been my favorite pass times. Weither it's diving into a new book and discovering new adventures. Or revisiting an old book and reliving those favorite adventures. Most books I read are in the area of Science Fiction and Fantasy, epic fantasys are amonge my favorite(think _Lord of the Rings_ type books). It's these big epic fantasy series that end up making me re-read books. There is always something you might missed in the first read through, that when you read it again a secound or third time that you finally see the big picture. Little moments or clues you over looked that end up coming to life. Now a days I don't have a lot of time to sit down and read phyical books but at work I'm mostly alone and my job is mostly stocking so I am constantly listening to audiobooks.

As a Millennial book nerd it kind of goes without saying that I am a big _Harry Potter_ fan. For me _Harry Potter_ is where I started out with reading. Before starting these books in 8th grade I was at a very low reading level, a couple years behind were I was suppose to be, so I really struggled with reading. In 5th grade we read the first book in an after school book club becasue parents didn't want it read during out loud reading time, so my teacher did an after school read aloud instead. I loved it so much that for christmas my mom got me the first 4 book(which was all that was out at the time). I never could get through them though, so me and my sister got the tapes from the library and listen to them. About half way through book 4 we had to return them because they were overdue. I was so in grossed in it that I grab the 4th book off my shelf and desided I was going to finish it myself. From then on I was hooked! I couldn't stop reading, my reading level jumped in one semester from being a couple years behind to be a couple years a head of my year. Which is why this series will always be special to me because without it I wouldn't be the reader I am today.
