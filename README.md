### **What you will find while _navigating_!**

> When going though the different tags above you will get to see some of the things I have done or like to do. Each section is filled with craft projects I've completed or are in the prosses of completing, different things I like to do with friends and loved ones. As well as book I love and books I plain on reading, and a projects or two I have completed for other programing classes that I reall enjoyed working on.
